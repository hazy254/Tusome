# TUSOME 

This is a project aiming to draw a list of bestsellers via the NYTimes API and display them to logged in users, allowing them to make their own reviews on the same. Completely built on Flask .
***
Future functionality to be added according to roadmap:
1. Genre preference selection after registration.
2. Voting functionality on user reviews.
3. User reputation system.
4. Forum functionality.
5. Google Books API for covers and synopsis.
6. Shift everything to AWS or Heroku.

Mostly built to refamiliarize myself with flask and learn new concepts on both frontend and backend by building a dynamic site from the ground up. Project is being built while aiming for a material design theme throughout the site( Color selection not settled on yet. )
